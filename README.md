# Task-4---Turtle-bot

Firstly, the programme asks the user where they would like to move.

then it asks how many rotations would they like the motors to rotate.

there is an integer inside the loop, that counts every time the motor has rotated.

the number of rotations is displayed to the user after the rotations are completed.

there is an ultrasonic sensor attached to the bot, wich is supposed to stop the bot 1 meter from any obstical that it comes across.
